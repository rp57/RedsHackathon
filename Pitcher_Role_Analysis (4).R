#JUSTIFICATION FOR RESEARCH QUESTION-----

'''
As you read above, our reasearch question focuses on finding relief pitchers that could be effective starting
pitchers. We believe that turning a relief pitcher to a starter could offer tremendious value to a team.
Relief pitchers get paid less in the free agent market, arbitration, and pre-arbitration. Getting a pitcher
at the monetary value of a relief pitcher, and utilizing them as starting could offer extreme surplus value.
Look below for more evidence.

These boxplots allow you to see the value a starting pitcher has relative to a relief pitcher.
They offer more overall WAR over the course of a season. One could say that is just because they pitch
more innings, but you can see that starting pitchers offer more WAR/IP as well. Thus the overall
accumulation is more, and their value per inning is greater as well.

#RELIEF PITCHERS WITH STARTING PITCHER PITCH MIX------

One major dtinguisher between starting pitchers and relief pitchers is having a diverse enough pitch mix
that allows you to face hitters multiple times.

'''
Here we discover a list 217 pitchers that were considered relief pitchers by fangraphs that have pitch mixes that are
comparable to that of a starting pitcher in terms of having/utilizing a fastball, breaking ball, and off-speed pitch.

LIMITATIONS:We used broader pitch type classifaction for simplification reasons. This does not paint the full picture
for pitchers who throw multiple types fast balls, breaking balls, and/or offspeed pitches. Another limitation
of this approach is that it does not look at how many pitches each pitcher throws to righty hitters vs. lefty
hitters and if that matters to have an effective pitch mix to be a starter versus reliever. We suggest future
iterations of this code to look for ways to define pitch mix to address these issues.

#RELIEVERS ADJUSTED STARTERS--------

'''
Through early exploratory analysis we discovered that relievers typically have better stuff_plus (hypothesis: they throw fewer
innings in an outing and can be more aggressive/throw with more strain per pitch) and lower location_plus (hypothesis: starters
have to throw more in the zone in order to record outs and go mutliple innings). We created a model below that adjusts all pitchers

#STAMINA-------

'''
Another factor for whether a reliever could be a starter, is if they have the stamina to pitch 5+ innings in an outing
and 160+ innings over the course of a season. This matters for whether they can be effective over the course of this many
innings and if they can do it without getting hurt. Below we look at a few different way to measure if pitchers can
effectively do so.
